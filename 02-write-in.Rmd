# The Write-In Databases {#writein}

The write-in databases are subjective, because they contain only publicly, and legally available information collected and organized by the Listen Local Collaboration with the oversight of local music curators. The write-in database of Listen Local Slovakia contains music that our Slovak music curators think to be Slovak music in one way or another.
