As a project of the Digital Music Observatory it aims to make big data work for small labels and self-released artists, and to make algorithms work for and not against them. Trustworthy Information All good music should find its audience. Local ecosystems, such as shops, events must find ways to play local music, introduce visitors to local artists, and make sure that some of the royalty payments (for example, paid by restaurants or bars) stays in the local music ecosystem. When somebody is shopping in Milan for fashion, in the shops some music from Milan and its regions should be played. Listen Local facilitates the best human-human and human-computer interactions, and makes sure that machine learning algorithms do not learn from bad information, leading to bad recommendations, and unsuccessful artist placements and low valuation and appreciation for their music. The Listen Local Databases are location-specific and subjective databases about artists and their works. Listen Local Slovakia contains artists and music references that are relevant in the context of Slovakia: the music is made in Slovakia, or the artists or music relates to the Slovak language and culture. Listen Local Gent is music relevant in the city of Gent. - ?? The Write-In Databases contain only publicly and legally available information collected and organized by the Listen Local Collaboration with the oversight of local music curators. The write-in databases contains information that our automated systems with the oversight of our curators write into them. For example, the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database contains music that our Slovak music curators subjectively think to be Slovak music in one way or another. Our curators use a sound and consistent set of criteria to write in music and artists into our databases, but they maintain their subjective and professional judgement. 3 The Opt-In Databases contain information that creator of the music provided about herself. The opt-in databases consist of two datasets: a closed and GDPR protected personal identification dataset and a public dataset that contains information released with the consent of the creator. Any artists can opt into our databases pending curatorial approval. (An artist can opt-in into the Slovak Comprehensive Database if he or she feels Slovak, pending the judgement of the curator that the inclusion of the artists will be relevant for music audiences and users looking for Slovak music.) Any artist can opt-out from the personal dataset without curatorial approval. 3.2 Any artist can opt-out from the personal dataset without curatorial approval. Special rules apply on deceased artistspartly, because GDPR no longer applies, partly, because identity will be relevant for new generations. For example, the classical work of Franz Liszt lived and worked in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his work may be credibly claimed by the audiences and researchers of Slovak (he worked much in the current Slovak capital of Bratislava), Hungarian (his place of birth) or the music heritage of the city of Weimar in Germany. The inclusion of his work Weimar, Hungary (very likely) or Japan (unlikely) specific datasets requires the judgement of our curators. The principles of the Listen Local system were outlined in the Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad. This study was supported by the Slovak Arts Council and the state51 music group, and it is avaialble in both English and Slovak languages1. Participate Listen Local is a highly automated system that uses open-source algorithms for automation and open, trustworthy AI. We deploy these technologies to help humans to work with music, enjoy music and participate in music. Keeping in mind a basic principle of ethical, trustworthy AI, our system is always maintaining human agency and oversight. 7 Curators are the most important collaborators to make Listen Local human-centered and ethical. They manage the write-in database and ensure that the automated systems collect and store correct information about artists and their music. To maintain ongoing data ownership of artists, they manage the opt-in and opt-out procedures for artists.

The write-in database of Listen Local Slovakia contains music that our Slovak music curators think to be Slovak music in one way or another. "],["optin.html", "3 The Opt-in Databases 3.1 Write-in: Getting Started with a new Listen Local Dataset 3.2 Opt-out Procedure 3.3 Deceased Artists", " 3 The Opt-in Databases The opt-in databases contain information that creator of the music provided about herself. The opt-in databases consist of two datasets: a closed and GDPR protected personal identification dataset and a public dataset that contains information released with the consent of the creator. Any artists can opt into our databases pending curatorial approval. (An artist can opt-in into the Slovak Comprehensive Database if he or she feels Slovak, pending the judgement of the curator that the inclusion of the artists will be relevant for music audiences and users looking for Slovak music.) Any artist can opt-out from the personal dataset without curatorial approval. Special rules apply on deceased artists. 3.1 Write-in: Getting Started with a new Listen Local Dataset Start with a Spotify playlist. Add artists that are relevant to your playlist. Please check out a starting playlist Listen Local Utrecht. Each playlist should be organized according to a location (how?) Let Reprexs Listen Local system create the initial write-in database. Review the database in Google Spreadsheet. 3.1.1 How location matters? 3.2 Opt-out Procedure Our opt-out procedure is always open for an artists who no longer wants to identify with one of our databases. Removal from the Opt-In Datasets requires no justification: these datasets contain information that fall under personal data protection rules. Removal from the Write-in Datasets requies a justification and pending curatorial decision. To give a hypotheticaland rather unlikelyscenario, an artist may inform Listen Local that she no longer identifies with Slovakia and wants to be deleted from the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database. We will immediately remove her from the Opt-in Datasets. However, if her music is widely perceived by audiences, musicologist, or local content regulation as Slovak, we may keep her work in the write-in datasets, clearly stating in the biographical information that the arits do not identify Slovak. A more likely case is that an artist is featured in a city-specific dataset in Gent, but he moves to San Francisco. The curator of the Gent dataset may feel that the artist left a large footprint in the music of Gent and list his work in Listen Local Gent, however, we may transfer the Opt-In (more personal data) to Listen Local SF and in the future keep including the work of the artists in San Franciscoespecially new work made in the new city. 3.3 Deceased Artists The music work of deceased artists has valuable copyrights and neighboring rights for many decades ahead. The heir of a Slovak composer may have an interest in making sure that people looking for Slovak music find it in the future. The opt-in procedure is therefore open for the heirs of deceased artists, pending curatorial judgement about the suitability of including the artist and her work into any of our databases. The opt-out procedure is open for the heirs if they can prove that the deceased artists explicitly wished to opt-out while still living. GDPR and many other rights do not apply for deceased people. Personal identification is a personal decision, and deceased people can no longer speak for themselves.

They manage the write-in database and ensure that the automated systems collect and store correct information about artists and their music. To maintain ongoing data ownership of artists, they manage the opt-in and opt-out procedures for artists. Our music curators play an essential role in making sure that big data works for all, inlcuding self-released artists and independent labels. Their work facilitates the best human-human and human-computer interactions, and makes sure that machine learning algorithms do not learn from bad information, leading to bad recommendations, and unsuccessful artist placements and low valuation and appreciation for their music.
